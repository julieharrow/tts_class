# Create an Atm Application that includes:
# An Account class
# 3 attributes: name, balance, pin
# Create 4 additional methods: display_balance, withdraw, deposit, and pin_error.
# The user should be prompted to enter their pin anytime they call display_balance, withdraw, or deposit.
# pin_error should contain  "Access denied: incorrect PIN." and be puts when the user types the wrong pin.
