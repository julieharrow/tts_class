<h1><strong>All About Julia!</strong></h1>
  <h2>Everything you might want to know about me, <br>
    that I'm willing to let you know...</h2>
    <p>I was born on a snowy day in Cleveland, Ohio, home of the World Champion Cleveland Caviliers!</p>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nba.com/cavaliers">HTML Cleveland Cavaliers</a></p>
    <p>It was a great place to grow up, but I had to spread by wings and see the world, so after graduation, I joined the Air Force.</p>
    <h2>I served at several glamorous bases:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Lackland AFB, San Antonio TX</li>
      <li>Cannon AFB, Clovis NM</li>
      <li>Lajes Field, Portual</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Eventually...</h2>
      <p>I returned to Cleveland and raised a family of my own, <br>
      my children Sara and Nolan grew up in Cleveland, and now they have children of their own, growing up in Northeast Ohio.</p>





    <h3>Currently, I work for Wake County Human Services where various services are offered to families in Wake County.</h3>

    <h3>I enjoy living in The Triangle and pursuing my many interests.  I enjoy several activities:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I learned how to Kayak this summer and enjoy it very much.</li>
        <li>I enjoy the Ballet, and hope to see the Symphony soon.</li>
        <li>My husband and I enjoy trying different restaurants, and I like to try to<br>
          cook different meals at home that we have tried.</li>
        <li>And I enjoy spending time with all the new friends I have made since I moved here.</li>
    </ul>
